Today, I would like to introduce the variation of adjective of Germany. Everyone who is not the native German speaker, in my view, has the same experience about the variation in German, which is soooo terrible to learner. Can you image that there are so many verbs that all have 16 forms, I mean, every verb?! To deal with this matter better, my teacher Herr Jia, who is my German teacher in Tongji-University, introduced a skill to us so that we can choose proper form to build a sentence quickly, easily and correctly. Well, please remember what I say below and do not forget the three tables!

> NOTICE: Nominativ = First grid;  Genitiv = Second grid;  Dativ = Third grid;  Akkusativ = Fourth grid.
>
> ​                 m = positive;  f = negative;  n = neutral;  pl = plural.

Firstly, the Table 1 is the variations of definite article, you could see that the basic forms in different position. I believe that I do not need to introduce the table, because this is the most basic form to everyone who are learning Deutsch, right?

Secondly, the Table 2 is suffixes of variation of owner pronoun. These two tables maintain the table 3 so that you could perfectly control the skill.

Finally, the master is coming! Table 3 is the variations of adjective, and you could see that there is "**xx/xx**" in the table. 

They are all the suffixes of adjective, and the left is the same as the table 1 and 2 besides "Genitiv of **m.** and **n.** ". According to Nominativ of **m, f, n, and pl**, the suffixes of **der, die, das, die** are **-er, -e, -es, -e** respectively. Similarly, the rule is suit for Genitiv(except **m and n**), Dativ and Akkusativ. 

What is more, the right are **- e** and **-en** respectively, and you just need to remember that 

* **Nominativ of m, f, and n** and 

* **Akkusativ of f and n** are **-e**, 

* others are **-en**. 

But 

* **Genitiv and Akkusativ of m**, 

* **Nominativ and Akkusativ of f**, 

* **Genitiv of n** 

* and **Dativ of pl** 

are special, which is that the left and right are the same as each other.

### How to use the rule?

Take it easy, it is a really easy method. You just need to judge one by one:

* der, die, das, or die?

* Nominativ, Genitiv, Dativ or Akkusativ?

* Is there related suffix, e.g. -er, -e, -es or -e, in the former? If there is no related suffix, the left in the Table 3 is right. If there is related suffix, the right in the Table 3 is right.

* Done.

Okay, let me give you some examples.

> #### No.1
>
> _Jung**en** Frauen gefallen modisch**e** Sachen._
>
> "Frauen" is pl. and Dativ. "Sachen" is pl. and Nominativ. So "Jungen" and "modische".
>
> #### No.2
>
> _Die grün**e** Krawatte passt nicht zu dem rot**en** Sakko, dem gelb**en** Hemd und der blau**en** Hose._
>
> "Krawatte" is f. and Nominativ and there is "die" in front of it, so "grüne" is right.
>
> "Sakko" is m. and Dativ and there is "dem" in front of it, so "roten" is right.
>
> Similarly, "Hemd" is m. and Dativ, and "Hose" is f. and Dativ, so "gelben" and "blauen" are right respectively.
>
> #### No.3
>
> Notice: viele, einige, wenige are special! The suffix of adjective follow them is the same as theirs.
>
> _Viel**e** chinesisch**e** alt**e** Frauen tragen gern dunkl**e** Kleidung. Aber viel**en** deutsch**en** alt**en** Frauen gefällt bunt**e** Kleidung._
