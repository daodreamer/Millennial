I would like to write down my two dreams occurred at the night in 10.11.2018 and 10.12.2018 respectively. The dreams, I have to say, are fantastic and dramatic indeed. Perhaps my English is not enough to describe what I want to share to you, but I will try my best to do it.

## No.1

Location: maybe in Nanjing(because I saw some buildings of Nanjing in my dream)

Roles: a girl and I

I cannot remember what time about the first scene happening. There was a girl,who was puzzle due to her face that is exactly like the face that people drink many alcohol, walked to me with the red sunshine. I think that the time maybe was approximate 16.00. Being a man, you know, I just felt excited about that. This is our first encounter with each other. However, the condition about the next stage is disappeared from my memory, and perhaps I will do forget that after two or three days. :(

Then the dream was changed to next scene. We jogged around the city and talked under the Platanus orientalis(法国梧桐) even I can clearly remember that I carried the girl in my arms, but I do not know her name and what she looks like. Besides, we have an encounter with each other in the train station. I just ran in the station to seek out something, because I missed the train I must taken off, and the weather was a snowing day with the whole white world. Meanwhile, I myself felt sad just like loosing a fairly important thing. At the same time the girl was walking to me. God! Can you feel about  that? The rest of negative senses were disappeared!

This is the whole process about my first dream. 

## NO.2

Location: maybe in my hometown(because I saw my senior school in my dream)

Roles: a girl and I

The dream I sharing to you is a crazy dream about a murderer. Exactly, it is me. If you would like to ask me the reason why I became a murderer, I just tell you I also do not know. However, I understand how I became a murderer. It was my curiosity.

Let me tell you the process I killed a man in my dream. There were two men on the mountain and I was a sniper. I would like to test my skill being a sniper so that I shot a man with my sniper rifle. Absolutely, this behavior was not admitted by world, so I had to avoid policemen and conceal my identity. The sense, you know, is not great to everyone even in my dream. Being a murderer, I experienced that was how terrible for me.

However, there was a girl still had never gave up to stay with me so that we became the enemies of the world. No matter where we lived, the organizations could find out us. We lived in an apartment of a square where was very busy and there were many shops below our apartment, so I believe that no one could find out us. Frankly, I was wrong. Then we tried to live in the hotel of swimming pool and somewhere I cannot remember, but we always could be sought out by them.

Finally, we arrived at my senior school, and, truly, both of us were terrible and tired. Meanwhile, I saw the class where students were learning in. It was surprised to me that I would like to join them at the same time. 

That's it!



**Consequently**, the reason why I can dream the two scenes is that, in my view, it is wonderful, romantic, exciting, crazy even gloomy no matter love or senior school. I suggest that the article has no enough logic and the words are not beautiful to describe my sense at that time, so I will improve my English so that I can share my stories more vivid.
