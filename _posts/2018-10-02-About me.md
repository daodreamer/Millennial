欢迎来到我的博客，我是DaoDreamer。历经两天时间终于在各种教程的帮助下用Github和jekyll搭建起了自己的博客，并且加入了中文的支持，表示很是兴奋XD，关于为什么搭建这个博客的原因呢有三点：

* 一是对于Github和jekyll的好奇想玩一玩试一试，毕竟我是个比较喜欢尝试新鲜玩意的人。
* 二是想记录一些好玩儿的事儿或者是有感触的东西，有可能是读后感观后感游记或者是对某个现象的评论，也可能是学习过程中的一点感悟，总之可以说是随笔吧。为了锻炼外语水平可能视情况会采用英文或德文，要是哪出错了希望可以帮我指出来（手动感谢）。
* 三是利用一些现有的网站建立一个博客感觉还是不太好，界面复杂太乱，有广告，而且不能随心所欲的修改和编辑，这些都可以在Github和jekyll搭建的这个博客中实现，体验很好！

不过我也还是个新手，如果你对我的博客比较感兴趣或者有什么更好的建议欢迎联系我，联系方式可以点击随处可见的这些小图标（微博QQ邮箱GITHUB）。

此外，如果你也想尝试搭建一个属于自己的博客欢迎你直接在github中fork[我的主题](https://github.com/daodreamer/daodreamer.github.io)，或者fork[原作者的github中的主题](https://github.com/LeNPaul/Millennial)。也欢迎互相交流经验！




Welcome to my blog, I'm DaoDreamer. Eventually, I have established my own blog by Github and jekyll via many many teaching lectures during two days, and today I add the function that can support Chinese to write down something. So I just feel excited about all of things XD. What's more, I'd like to talk about three reasons why I want to set up a Blog.

* Firstly, I have some interests about the Github and jekyll, and want to understand how they work so that I can talk to you here(maybe I just talk with myself?? That's okay.....). 

* Secondly, being a human, there are frequently many ideas or words in my mind so that I want record them in my blog. Perhaps they are some words I want to share about a moive, a book, a republication, a daily about my trip or a comment about a phenomenon even experience that is produced by the learning process in my road. Besides, to improve my capacity of language, maybe I will write a article with English or German(RIGHT! I'm learning German now), so if you find out some problems, please contact me. Thx!

* Finally, some websites, in my view, are not great to me, because there are terrible layout and several ads and I can not modify my own blog to reach my idea! However, rest of them can be realized here via Github and jekyll!

Frankly, I'm also a fresh, so if you are interested in my blog or have some better recommendations, you could contact me by these icons(at the top and below, e.g, Weibo, QQ, Email or Github).

Also, if you would like to set up your blog, you could fork my theme on [my github page](https://github.com/daodreamer/daodreamer.github.io) or [original author's theme](https://github.com/LeNPaul/Millennial). Welcome to exchange our mind to each other!
